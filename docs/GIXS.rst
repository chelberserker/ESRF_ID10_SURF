Grazing Incidence X-ray Scattering
==========================================

This class is currently under development. It will be dedicated to processing data obtained with a 2D detectors.
It is a common use case for GISAXS and GIWAXS measurement on the beamline, where scattering is captured using one Dectris Eiger 4M CdTe detector with a large area.
