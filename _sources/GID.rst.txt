GID Class
=========

The ``GID`` class provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing Grazing Incidence Diffraction data. This technique is widely used to probe the in-plane structure of thin films and surfaces. The class abstracts the complexities of data loading, normalization, and transformation into reciprocal space, offering a user-friendly interface for scientific analysis.

Overview
--------

Grazing Incidence Diffraction (GID) involves directing X-rays at a surface at a very shallow angle, typically below the critical angle for total external reflection. This configuration maximizes surface sensitivity and minimizes background signal from the bulk substrate. The scattered intensity is recorded as a function of the in-plane scattering angle and the out-of-plane angle, providing information about the lateral organization of molecules or atoms at the interface.

The ``GID`` class is designed to streamline this workflow for the ID10 beamline at ESRF. It automates the following steps:

*   **Data Ingestion:** Reads raw data from HDF5 files generated by the beamline control system. It handles single or multiple scans, concatenating them as needed.
*   **Normalization:** Corrects raw counts for monitor intensity (incident flux variations), transmission, and other experimental factors.
*   **Reciprocal Space Conversion:** Converts detector pixel coordinates and motor angles into physical scattering vectors ($q_{xy}$ and $q_z$).
*   **Detector Gap Handling:** The specific detector used (Mythen) has physical gaps between modules. The class stitches the data correctly or handles the gaps to produce a continuous image in reciprocal space.
*   **Visualization:** Provides built-in methods to plot 2D maps of intensity in reciprocal space, as well as 1D cuts (profiles) along specific directions ($q_{xy}$ or $q_z$).
*   **Analysis:** Includes methods for fitting peaks using various lineshapes (Gaussian, Lorentzian, Voigt) to extract structural parameters like lattice spacing and coherence length.

Key Features
------------

*   **Flexible ROI Integration:** Easily extract 1D intensity profiles by integrating over a region of interest (ROI) in the orthogonal direction.
*   **Automated Plotting:** Quick "standard analysis" plots allow for immediate data inspection during or after an experiment.
*   **Data Export:** Save processed data (cuts, 2D maps) in standard formats (ASCII .dat, HDF5, images) for publication or further analysis with external tools.
