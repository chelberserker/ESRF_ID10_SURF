=================
ID10-SURF data processing
=================

Welcome to the documentation for ``esrf_id10_surf``, a Python package for analyzing surface X-ray scattering data from the ID10 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF).

This package provides tools for processing:

*   **Grazing Incidence Diffraction (GID)**: For analyzing in-plane structure.
*   **X-ray Reflectivity (XRR)**: For analyzing out-of-plane structure, thickness, and roughness.
*   **Grazing Incidence Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (GISAXS)**: (Under development)
